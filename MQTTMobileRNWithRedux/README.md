# React Native with MQTT through web sockets using Redux
An example React Native app that shows how to connect to an MQTT server with webscockets using [paho.mqtt.javascript](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.javascript). I used [react_native_mqtt](https://github.com/Introvertuous/react_native_mqtt) before, but it's not necessary any longer, the Paho client can be used directly.

## How to run it
You should be able to follow the normal react native instructions to run it:
- Install dependencies with `yarn install`
- Run project with `react-native run-android`
